Hello, here is the repo for my utilitarian Discord Bot made in Kotlin.

## Why creating her ?

There is already a lot of bots present on Discord, but I still wanted
to make a bot for 2 main reasons :

- Bots online don't really do exactly what I want
- I prefer to have the fewer bots possible on my servers
- That's always a good way of training

## Libraries/Language(s) used

On this project I used :
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
> As the main language for the bot, I recently took a liking to it.
- [Discord4j](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J)
> To communicate between my scripts and Discord.
- [Kotlin Coroutines (Reactor)](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/tree/master/reactive/kotlinx-coroutines-reactor)
> To make asynchronous calls as Discord4J uses [Project Reactor](https://projectreactor.io/).
